describes how to use the class file, and also makes some remarks about typesetting a document by using \LaTeXe. The design is based on \LaTeXe.\end{abstract}\begin{keyword}Class file, \LaTeXe\end{keyword}\maketitle\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}This document describes how to handle the \ClassFile\  for the Transactions of the Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.Section~\ref{template} explains how to typeset according to the template. \texttt{template.tex} which is distributed with the \ClassFile\ can be used. Section~\ref{generalnote} describes a special feature of \ClassFile, which is different to the \texttt{article.cls} provided by the standard \LaTeXe\ and which points may be aware of on writing a paper and so on. Section~\ref{typesetting} is about typographic notes, which explains how to typeset, how to prevent typographic errors and how to handle long formulas. For information about printing on A4 paper and making pdf file, see Appendix (p.\pageref{sec:pdf}). \section{Template and How to Typeset the Paper and Letter}\label{template}\subsection{Type of the Paper}Here is the template of the paper. \begin{verbatim}\documentclass[english]{ieej-e}\usepackage{graphicx}\usepackage[varg]{txfonts}\FIELD{A}\YEAR{2011}\NO{1}\title[]{title}\authorlist{%

\begin{verbatim}\usepackage[varg]{txfonts}\end{verbatim}Note that if you require \texttt{amsmath} packages, it must be specified before \texttt{txfonts} package. \itemThe \verb/\FIELD/ command is used for the footer. Its argument indicates the categories of IEEJ transactions (see Table 1 of ``Author's Guidelines for the Transactions of the Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan''). For example, in the case of ``Fundamental and Materials'' \texttt{A} is specified as the argument of \verb/\FIELD/. \itemThe \verb/\YEAR/ command is used for the footer. The year of publication is assigned as \verb/\YEAR{2011}/. \itemThe \verb/\NO/ command is also used for the footer. The number of the issue is assigned as \verb/\NO{1}/. Those two commands are optional. If you do not know which issue your paper to be appear, they may be commented out or left blank.\itemThe title of a paper is assigned in \verb/\title/. You may use \verb/\\/ to start a new line in a long title. The argument of the \verb/\title/ command is used for more than just producing a title, it is also used to generate a running head. A shorter title should be specified within 8 words as follows. \noindent\verb/\title[/% \textit{short title}\verb/]{/%  \textit{title}\verb/}/\itemThe outputs of authors' names, memberships and marks of affiliates are automatically generated by using the \verb/\authorlist/ and \verb/\authorentry/ commands. The \verb/\authorentry/ command must be described as an argument of the \verb/\authorlist/ command. The \verb/\authorentry/ command has three arguments. \noindent\verb/\authorentry{/\textit{name}% \verb/}{/\textit{membership}%  \verb/}{/\textit{label}%   \verb/}/For example, they could be typesetted as follows: \begin{verbatim*}\authorlist{%\authorentry{Taro Denshi}{m}{TRL}\authorentry{Hanako Denki}{n}{KEC}}\end{verbatim*}\begin{itemize}\itemThe first argument of \verb/\authorentry/ is filled with the author's name. \itemThe second argument is specified by one letter out of seven letters (m, a, s, l, n, h, S, f), each one indicating the membership of authors as the following table shows. \onelineskip\begin{center}\begin{small}\begin{tabular}{lll}\hline\texttt{m} & Member\rule{0mm}{3.5mm}\\\texttt{a} & Associate\\\texttt{s} & Student Member\\\texttt{l} & Life Member\\\texttt{n} & Non-member\\\texttt{h} & Honorary Member\\\texttt{S} & Senior Member\\\texttt{f} & Fellow\\\hline\multicolumn{3}{p{65mm}}{\footnotesize  the left column is letters to be specified.  the right column is membership to be generated.}\end{tabular}\end{small}\end{center}\onelineskipNo extra spaces may be added between a letter and a brace. \verb*/{m}/ and \verb*/{m }/ are regarded as different. The latter will not generate ``Member''. \itemThe third argument is assigned by the label of the author's affiliate, corresponding to the label of the \verb/\affiliate/ command (see below). For example, an abbreviation for a university, institute or company can be given. If an author does not have an affiliate, \texttt{none} must be specified. \itemYou might specify e-mail address as follows. \begin{verbatim}\authorentry[TaroDenshi@iee.or.jp] {Taro Denshi}{m}{TRL}\end{verbatim}The following words ared generated on the left side at the bottom of the first page.\hfil\break``a) Correspondence to: TaroDenshi@iee.or.jp''\itemThe \verb/\authorentry/ command lists the authors' names and affiliates one by one. If more than 10 authors are listed, the list occupies almost a half of the page. Therefore, if you specify as follows, \begin{verbatim}\def\authoralign{2}\end{verbatim}then, it will list the names two per line. The argument of \verb/\authoralign/ must be 1 or 2. \end{itemize}%\item%If you need to inform a pesent affiliate, %4th argument of the \verb/\authorentry/ command can be used %as follows. %%\noindent%\verb/\authorentry{/\textit{name}%% \verb/}{/\textit{membership}%%  \verb/}{/\textit{label}%%   \verb/}[/%    \textit{LABEL}%%     \verb/]/%%The 4th argument is corresponding to %the label of a \verb/\paffiliate/ command (see below). \itemAn author's affiliate is described in the \verb/\affiliate/ command as follows. \verb/\affiliate[/\textit{label}% \verb/]{/\textit{affiliate}%%  \verb/\\/\textit{address}%%  \verb/}/The first argument ``\textit{label}'' must be the same as the 3rd argument of the \verb/\authorentry/ command. The second argument is assigned by both the author's affiliate and address, which are separeted by \verb/\\/. No extra spaces may be added between a letter and a brace in the first \textit{label} argument. The entry of \verb/\affiliate/ must be followed by the order of labels in \verb/\authorlist/ commands. %\item%The author's present affiliate is described %in the \verb/\paffiliate/ command as follows. %%\verb/\paffiliate[/\textit{label}%% \verb/]{/\textit{affiliate}%%%  \verb/\\/\textit{address}%%%  \verb/}/%%The first argument \textit{label} must be the same as %the 4th argument of \verb/\authorentry/ command. \itemIf the labels of \verb/affiliate/ are different from those of \verb/\authorentry/, there will be a warning message on your terminal.  \itemBoth the \verb/\received/ and \verb/\revised/ commands are used for the date of receipt and revision of the paper. For example, the date of receipt is assigned as \verb/\received{2011}{1}{23}/ and the date of revision is assigned as \verb/\revised{2011}{3}{15}/. Both commands will generate the following strings below authors' names. \noindent``(Manuscript received January 23, 2011, revised March 15, 2011)''\itemThe text of the abstract is described in the \texttt{abstract} environment. The text should be a maximum of 150 to 200 words.The text of the keywords is described in the \texttt{keyword} environment. The text should be a maximum of 6 words.\itemThe \verb/\maketitle/ command must come after those commands before the main text begins. \itemThe \verb/\appendix/ command of the standard \LaTeXe\ is a declarationthat changes the way sectional units are numbered. But \verb/\appendix/ of \ClassFile\ generates the heading ``Appendix''and appendix sections are numbered ``1'', ``2'', etc., appendix equation numbers are numbered ``(A1)'', ``(A2)'', etc., appendix figure numbers are numbered ``app.\,Fig.\,1'', ``app.\,Fig.\,2'', etc. \itemThe \verb/\acknowledgment/ command is available if you might express your gratitude. \itemAuthors' profile on page \pageref{profile} is generated with: \begin{verbatim}\begin{biography}\profile{m}{Denshi Taro}{%was born in Kumamoto, Japan, on August 15, 1972. ... }\profile{n}{Denki Hanako}{%was born in Okayama, Japan, on February 25, 1960. ... }\end{biography}\end{verbatim}\begin{itemize}\itemThe first argument of the \verb/\profile/ command is specified by one letter out of seven letters (m, a, s, l, n, h, S) the same as the second argument of \verb/\authorentry/. The second and third arguments are filled with an author's name and profile respectively. \itemIf EPS (see p.\pageref{EPS}) files of pictures of the authors' faces are provided, put the EPS files named \texttt{a1.eps}, \texttt{a2.eps}, etc., which are followed by the order of authors, on the current directory of your computer(a1.pdf when compiling with \verb/\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}/). The \verb/\profile/ command automatically reads their files and puts their pictures on the left margin. The ratio of EPS file must be width : height = 22 : 28, because EPS files are read by the following command. \begin{verbatim}\resizebox{22mm}{28mm} {\includegraphics{a1.eps}}\end{verbatim}If their files don't exist in the current directory, simple frames will be generated (see p.\pageref{profile}). \end{itemize}Pictures of the authors' faces may be omitted by using the \verb/\profile*/ command instead of the \verb/\profile/ command. \end{itemize}\subsection{Type of the Letter}\texttt{letter} option must be added as follows. \begin{verbatim}\documentclass[english,letter]{ieej-e}\end{verbatim}An abstract should be about 100 words. Authors' profiles may be omitted. \section{Special Feature of \ClassFile}\label{generalnote}\subsection{Formula}\ClassFile\ includes \texttt{dotseqn.sty} in order to fill a space between a formula and a formula number with dots. A displayed formula is aligned on the left, a fixed distance (6.5\,mm) from the left margin, instead of being centered. A formula number is put on the right side, 3.25\,mm from the right margin, in the \texttt{equation} and \texttt{eqnarray} environments. The following is an example of a displayed formula. If you type below, \begin{verbatim}\begin{eqnarray}\lefteqn{ \int\!\!\!\int_S  \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right) dxdy} \quad\nonumber\\ &=& \oint_C \left(U \frac{dx}{ds}      + V \frac{dy}{ds} \right)ds\end{eqnarray}%\end{verbatim}then, you get the following. \begin{eqnarray}\lefteqn{ \int\!\!\!\int_S  \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right) dxdy} \quad\nonumber\\ &=& \oint_C \left(U \frac{dx}{ds}      + V \frac{dy}{ds} \right)ds\end{eqnarray}%A width of one column is narrow to compose displayed formulas.Therefore, you should compose equations with the proper length, paying attention to the message ``\verb/Overfull/ \verb/\hbox/''.\subsection{Theorem-like Environment}If you use the \verb/\newtheorem/ environment, pay attention to the following points. There are no additional vertical spaces before and after the environment, and the text within the environment does not appear in italics. An example is given as follows. \begin{verbatim}\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}\begin{theorem}There are no positive integers such that $x^n + y^n = z^n$ for $n>2$. I've found a remarkable proof of this fact, but there is not enough space in the margin [of the book] to write it. (Fermat's last theorem). \end{theorem}\end{verbatim}\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}\begin{theorem}There are no positive integers such that $x^n + y^n = z^n$ for $n>2$. I've found a remarkable proof of this fact, but there is not enough space in the margin [of the book] to write it. (Fermat's last theorem). \end{theorem}\subsection{Footnotes}The footnote begins with ``$^\dagger$'' (see p.\pageref{fnsample}). As the footnote counter increases, the footnote marks proceed as ``$^\dagger$'', ``$^{\dagger\dagger}$'', ``$^{\dagger\dagger\dagger}$''. The footnote mark is set to reset at each page.\subsection{Figures and Tables}The font size inside the \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table} environmentsis set \verb/\footnotesize/ (7\,pt). The \texttt{[h]} option, one of the arguments of floating environment specifying a location where the float may be placed, is not recommended. Figures and tables should be located at the top or bottom of a pageby using \texttt{[tb]} etc.\ for the transactions of IEEJ. \subsubsection{Including Graphics}\label{EPS}Although there are many ways to include pictures and figures in \LaTeX, the Encapsulated \PS\ format (EPS) is recommended. Here is a simple explanation to insert graphics into the text. The \texttt{graphics} or \texttt{graphicx} package must be loaded. \texttt{dvips} is one device driver's option and it might be changed according to a device driver you useor might be omitted. \begin{verbatim}\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}\end{verbatim}A graphics file (EPS file) produced by another program can be included with the \verb/\includegraphics/ command. \begin{verbatim}\begin{figure}[tb]\begin{center}\includegraphics{file.eps}\end{center}\caption{...}\label{fig:1}\end{figure}\end{verbatim}If the option \texttt{scale=0.5} is given, the graphics will be scaled by half. \begin{verbatim}\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{file.eps}\end{verbatim}You can get the same result as above by using the \verb/\scalebox/ command. \begin{verbatim}\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{file.eps}}\end{verbatim}If the option \texttt{width=30mm} is given, the width of graphics will be 30\,mm(with the height proportionally scaled). \begin{verbatim}\includegraphics[width=30mm]{file.eps}\end{verbatim}The next is another example using \verb/\resizebox/. \begin{verbatim}\resizebox{30mm}{!} {\includegraphics{file.eps}}\end{verbatim}Both dimension of width and height can be specified as follows. \begin{verbatim}\includegraphics[width=30mm,height=40mm] {file.eps}\end{verbatim}or \begin{verbatim}\resizebox{30mm}{40mm} {\includegraphics{file.eps}}\end{verbatim}For further information about the graphics package, see reference book \Cite{latexbook,FMi2}. \begin{figure}[t]% fig.1\setbox0\vbox{%\hbox{\verb/\begin{figure}[tbp]/}\hbox{\verb/... floating materials .../}\hbox{\verb/\capwidth=50mm/}\hbox{\verb/\caption{An example of

English.}\label{fig:1}\end{figure}\subsubsection{Captions of Floating Environment}\label{caption}The width of caption is set 72\,mm (single column) and 0.8\verb/\textwidth/ (double column). It can be set by changing the value of \verb/\capwidth/ (see Fig.\,\ref{fig:1})\begin{table}[t]% Table 1\caption{An example of table caption in English.}\label{table:1}\setbox0\vbox{%\hbox{\verb/\begin{table}[b]%[tbp]/}\hbox{\verb/\caption{An example of table caption in

Z\\/}\hbox{\verb/\hline/}\hbox{\verb/\end{tabular}/}\hbox{\verb/\end{center}/}\hbox{\verb/\end{table}/}}\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\hlineA & B & C\\\hlineX & Y & Z\\\hline\end{tabular}\halflineskip\fbox{\box0}\end{center}\vskip-2mm\end{table}\subsection{Verbatim Environment}You can change the values of the parameters in the verbatim environmentwhich is customized for \ClassFile. The default settings are: \begin{verbatim}\verbatimleftmargin=0pt\def\verbatimsize{\normalsize}\verbatimbaselineskip=\baselineskip\end{verbatim}The leftmargin of the verbatim environment is set 0pt. The font size is set \verb/\normalsize/. The baselineskip is set the same of normal texts. For example, those parameters can be changed as follows: \begin{verbatim}\verbatimleftmargin=6.5mm\def\verbatimsize{\footnotesize}\verbatimbaselineskip=3mm\end{verbatim}\subsection{Bibliography and Citations}\ClassFile\ includes the \texttt{citesort.sty} with a little customized. The \texttt{citesort.sty} collapses a list of three or more consecutive numbers into a range, and sorts the numbers before collapsing them. For example, ``\cite{Bech} \cite{Gr} \cite{PA} \cite{Seroul}\cite{texbook} \cite{Salomon}''is transformed into ``\cite{Bech,Gr,PA,Seroul,texbook,Salomon}''. The \verb/\cite/ command displays citations as superscript numbers. To get ``ref.~\Cite{texbook}'', the \verb/\Cite/ command can be used. In the \texttt{thebibliography} environment, place references in the right order according to the IEEJ editing style; e.g., authors' names, initials, title of article, journal abbreviation, volume number, pages, and publication year. Journals are italicized as \verb/\itshape/, and titles of papers enclosed with ``\ '' in plain text. \subsection{Make All Text Pages the Same Height}\mbox{}\par\verb/\flushbottom/ is declared in \ClassFile. It makes all text pages the same height, adding extra vertical space when neccessary to fill out the page. \subsection{AMS Packages}The \AmSLaTeX\ packages are provided to typeset complex equations or other mathematical constructions. If you would like to use them, the \texttt{amsmath} package should be loaded with the \texttt{fleqn} option. \begin{verbatim}\usepackage[fleqn]{amsmath}\end{verbatim}When the \texttt{amsmath} package is loaded, many environments, for example the \texttt{equation}, \texttt{align}, \texttt{gather}, \texttt{multiline} and \texttt{split} environments etc.,\ will not automatically generate dots between a formula and a formula number. One primitive way to resolve this problem is to typeset as follows at the end of the formula. \begin{verbatim}\rlap{\hbox to 10mm{\ \EqnDots}} \end{verbatim}This puts the leaders of width 10\,mm into a box of width zero, extending to the right of the current position. While the \texttt{amsmath} package presents many functions, only the \verb/\boldsymbol/ command which is to be used for individual bold math symbols and bold Greek letters is needed, only the \texttt{amsbsy} package should be loaded. \begin{verbatim}\usepackage{amsbsy}\end{verbatim}When the \texttt{amssymb} package is loaded, many extra math symbols of the \AmSLaTeX\ fonts will become available\cite{FMi1}. \begin{verbatim}\usepackage[psamsfonts]{amssymb}\end{verbatim}\subsection{Miscellaneous}\subsubsection{Macros Defined by \ClassFile}\label{sec:macros}\begin{itemize}\item\verb/\QED/: Produces ``$\Box$'' in the end of the proof and so on. You would get the same output by using \verb/\hfill $\Box$/. But if the end of a paragraph goes to the right margin, the character $\Box$ is positioned at the start of a line.Using \verb/\QED/ will prevent such cases.\item\verb/\halflineskip/ and \verb/\onelineskip/: Produce a vertical space, 1/2\verb/\baselineskip/, 1\verb/\baselineskip/ respectively.\itemAs shown in Table \ref{table:2}, the macros \verb/\RN/ and \verb/\FRAC/ are defined\cite{texbook}. \begin{table}[t]% Table 2\caption{\texttt{\symbol{"5C% "}}\texttt{FRAC} and \texttt{\symbol{"5C% "}}\texttt{RN}}\label{table:2}\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}\noalign{\hrule height 0.4mm}\verb/\RN{2}/ & \RN{2} \\\verb/\RN{117}/ & \RN{117} \\\hline\verb/\FRAC{$\pi$}{2}/ & \FRAC{$\pi$}{2}\\\verb/\FRAC{1}{4}/ & \FRAC{1}{4} \\\noalign{\hrule height 0.4mm}\end{tabular}\end{center}\end{table}\item\verb/\ddash/: Produce double ``---''. double ``\texttt{---}'' sometimes produce thin space between two ``---''. \verb/\ddash/ will prevent such a case. \end{itemize}\section{Typographic Notes}\label{typesetting}\subsection{How to Prevent Typographic Errors}\begin{enumerate}\itemYou should pay attention to a space after a period. ``\TeX\ simply assumes that a period ends a sentence unlessit follows an uppercase letter. This works most of the time, but not always---abbreviations like `etc.'\ being the mostcommon exception. You tell \TeX\ that a period doesn't end a sentence by using a \verb*/\ / command (a \verb/\/character followed by a space or the end of a line) to make the space after the period.''``On the rare occasions that a sentence-ending periodfollows an uppercase letter, you will have to tell \TeX\ that the period ends the sentence. You do this by preceding the period with a \verb/\@/ command.''\cite{latexbook}\texttt{Beans} \texttt{(lima, etc.)}\verb/\/ \texttt{have vitamin B}\verb/\@/. \item``Line breaking should be prevented at certain interword spaces. ... Trying \~\ (a tilde character) produces an ordinary interwordspace at which \TeX\ will never break a line.''\cite{latexbook}\verb/Mr.~Jones/, \verb/Figure~\ref{fig:1}/, \verb/(1)~gnats/.\itemWith respect to Figure, Section, Equation, when these words appear at the beginning of a sentence, they should be spelt out in full, e.g., ``Figure~1 shows...'' is used. When they appear in the middle of a sentence, abbreviations, e.g.,\ ``in Fig.\,1'', ``in Sect.\,2'', ``in Eq.\,3'' should be used.\itemThere should be no space after opening or before closing parentheses, as in \verb*/( word )/.\itemThere are many cases of an inappropriate application of a \verb/\\/ or \verb/\newline/ command except in the tabular environment etc., such as two \verb/\\/ commands in succession or \verb/\\/ command just before a blank line. They will often cause warning messages like \texttt{Underfull} \verb/\hbox .../, as a result it would often prevent you from finding important warning messages. The use of \verb/\par\noindent/ or \verb/\hfil\break/ commands is recommended and gives you the same effect without warning messages. \itemThere are some cases of an inappropriate application of a \verb/\\/in descriptions such as program lists.Use of the \texttt{tabbing} environment or \texttt{list} environment is recommended. \itemThe difference in the use of the hyphen (\texttt{-}), en dash (\texttt{--}) and em dash (\texttt{---}) should be noted. A hyphen is used in connecting English-language words such as `well-known', and an en dash is used when expressing a range such as `pp.298--301'.The em dash is even longer---it's used as punctuation. \itemThe difference when hyphen and en dash are used in maths mode should also be noted. Some examples are given below. \begin{verbatim}$A^{\mathrm{b}\mbox{-}\mathrm{c}}$\end{verbatim}$A^{\mathrm{b}\mbox{-}\mathrm{c}}$ $\Rightarrow$ hyphen\begin{verbatim}$A^{\mathrm{b}\mbox{--}\mathrm{c}}$\end{verbatim}$A^{\mathrm{b}\mbox{--}\mathrm{c}}$ $\Rightarrow$ en dash\begin{verbatim}$A^{b-c}$\end{verbatim}$A^{b-c}$ $\Rightarrow$ minus sign\par\itemThe less-than sign ``$<$'' (\verb/</, a relation) should not be confused with ``$\langle$'' (\verb/\langle/, a delimiter). The same is true for the greater-than sign ``$>$'' and ``$\rangle$''.\itemA unary operator and a binary operator: ``A $+$ or $-$ that begins a formula (or certain subformulas) is assumed to be a unary operator, so typing \verb/$-x$/ produces $-x$ and typing \verb/$\sum - x_{i}$/ produces $\sum - x_{i}$, with no space between the ``$-$'' and ``x''. If the formula is part of a larger one that is being split across lines, \TeX\ must be told that the $+$ or $-$ is a binary operator. This is done by starting the formula with aninvisible first term, produced by an \verb/\mbox/ commandwith a null argument.''\cite{latexbook} \begin{verbatim}\begin{eqnarray}y &=& a + b + c + ... + e\\  & & \mbox{} + f + ... \end{eqnarray}\end{verbatim}\item\verb/\allowbreak/ may be used within long maths formulas in paragraphs instead of using \verb/\hfil\break/, \verb/\\/ or \verb/\linebreak/, since \TeX\ is reluctant to break lines there. \end{enumerate}\subsection{How to Handle Long Formulas}\label{longformula}Here are some explanations how to handle long formulas, for example, overhanged equations, equations overriding the equation number, and so forth. \halflineskip\hfuzz10pt\noindent\textbf{Example 1}: \begin{equation} y=a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m\end{equation}The equation is too long, and the space between the equation and the equation number are too narrow and sometimes the equation number moves to the right. In this case the \verb/\!/ command is useful. ``The \verb/\!/ acts like a backspace, removing the same space amount of space that \verb/\,/ adds.''\cite{latexbook}\begin{verbatim}\begin{equation} y\!=\!a\!+\!b\!+\!c\!+\! ... \!+\!m\end{equation}\end{verbatim}\begin{equation} y\!=\!a\!+\!b\!+\!c\!+\!d\!+\!e\!+\!f     \!+\!g\!+\!h\!+\!i\!+\!j\!+\!k\!+\!l\!+\!m\end{equation}\halflineskip\noindent\textbf{Example 2}: Using \texttt{eqnarray} environment instead of \texttt{equation} environment. \begin{verbatim}\begin{eqnarray} y &=& a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h\nonumber\\   & & \mbox{}+i+j+k+l+m+n+o\end{eqnarray}\end{verbatim}To typeset above, you will get the following output. \begin{eqnarray} y &=& a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h\nonumber\\   & & \mbox{}+i+j+k+l+m+n+o\end{eqnarray}\halflineskip\noindent\textbf{Example 3}: To change the value of \verb/\mathindent/ is to change the position that the equation begins%\footnote{This explanation is appropriate to left-aligns displayed formulas, not to centering formulas.}. \label{fnsample}%\begin{verbatim}\mathindent=0mm % <-- [1]\begin{equation} y=a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m\end{equation}\mathindent=6.5mm % <-- [2] default value\end{verbatim}To typeset above (see \texttt{[1]}), you will get the following output. \mathindent=0mm\begin{equation} y=a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m\end{equation}\mathindent=6.5mmThe value of \verb/\mathindent/ must be restored (see \texttt{[2]}). \halflineskip\noindent\textbf{Example 4}: \begin{equation} \int\!\!\!\int_S \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} \right)dxdy= \oint_C \left(U\frac{dx}{ds}+V\frac{dy}{ds}\right)ds \hskip-3.5mm %% --> oppress `Overful \hbox ...' message \end{equation}The equation is too long and overrides the equation number. In this case the \verb/\lefteqn/ command is useful. It can be used for splitting long formulas across lines as follows. \begin{verbatim}\begin{eqnarray} \lefteqn{  \int\!\!\!\int_S   \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}  -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right) dxdy }\quad \nonumber\\ &=& \oint_C \left(U \frac{dx}{ds}      + V \frac{dy}{ds} \right)ds\end{eqnarray}\end{verbatim}To typeset above, you will get the following output. \begin{eqnarray}\lefteqn{ \int\!\!\!\int_S   \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}   -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right)    dxdy }\quad\nonumber\\ &=& \oint_C \left(U \frac{dx}{ds}      + V \frac{dy}{ds} \right)ds\end{eqnarray}\halflineskip\noindent\textbf{Example 5}: A matrix using the \texttt{array} environment. \begin{equation}A = \left(  \begin{array}{cccc}   a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\   a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \\   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\   a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \\  \end{array}    \right) \label{eq:ex1}\end{equation}The width of a matrix can be shrunkby changing the value of \verb/\arraycolsep/ or using an \texttt{@}-expression (\verb/@{}/). \begin{verbatim}\begin{equation}\arraycolsep=3pt %     <--- [1]A = \left(  \begin{array}{@{\hskip2pt}%%  <-- [2]                cccc                @{\hskip2pt}%%  <-- [2]               }   a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\   a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \\   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\   a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \\  \end{array}    \right) \end{equation}\end{verbatim}The \verb/\arraycolsep/ dimension is half the width of a horizontal space between columns in the \texttt{array} environment. A matrix using the \texttt{array} environment can be shrunkby changing the value of \verb/\arraycolsep/ (see \texttt{[1]}). And also it can be shrunk by using \texttt{@}-expression (see \texttt{[2]}). \begin{equation}\arraycolsep=3ptA = \left(  \begin{array}{@{\hskip2pt}cccc@{\hskip2pt}}   a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\   a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \\   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\   a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \\  \end{array}    \right) \label{eq:ex2}\end{equation}Compare Eqs.\,(\ref{eq:ex1}) and (\ref{eq:ex2}). \halflineskip\hfuzz.5pt\noindent\textbf{Example 6}: A matrix using a \verb/\pmatrix/. \begin{verbatim}\begin{equation} \def\quad{\hskip.75em\relax}% <-- [1] %% default setting is \hskip1em A = \pmatrix{      a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \cr      a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \cr      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr      a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \cr     }\end{equation}\end{verbatim}In the case of the equation using \verb/\pmatrix/, the definition of \verb/\quad/ can be changed (see \texttt{[1]}). If \texttt{amsmath} packages is loaded, the \texttt{pmatrix} environment (\verb/\begin{pmatrix}/ and \verb/\end{pmatrix}/) must be selected instead of \verb/\pmatrix/.In that case the explanation on Example 5 is useful. %%%%\[% \begin{pmatrix}%      a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \cr%      a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \cr%      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr%      a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \cr% \end{pmatrix}%\]%\[% \arraycolsep1pt% \begin{pmatrix}%      a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \cr%      a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \cr%      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr%      a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \cr% \end{pmatrix}%\]%%%\begin{thebibliography}{99}\bibitem{texbook}D.E.
